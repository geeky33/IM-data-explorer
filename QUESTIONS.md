QUESTIONS TO ASK MY MENTORS


ðŸ”¹ High-Level Understanding
What specific goals of IMDE should be achieved by integrating parts of AnnFlux?

Do we intend to use AnnFlux as a submodule/library, or only extract concepts from it?

ðŸ”¹ Technical Integration
Should IMDE directly use AnnFluxâ€™s CLIP embedding pipeline and PCA logic, or reimplement our own version for modularity?

Can we rely on AnnFlux's CLI-based flow, or should IMDE be structured as a more modular Python library?

How important is AnnFluxâ€™s current active learning logic for our use case â€” or should we design our own selection strategy?

ðŸ”¹ Dataset and Annotation Compatibility
Should IMDE use the same folder structure as AnnFlux (data/project/images) or align with Datumaroâ€™s dataset formats instead?

Is it expected that we modify AnnFlux to support multimodal datasets (e.g., text captions + images) natively within the tool?

ðŸ”¹ UI and User Interaction
Is the current UI of AnnFlux sufficient for our needs, or are we expected to build a new frontend from scratch for IMDE?

Can parts of FluxIt (if it's more UI-focused) be integrated with AnnFlux's backend or reused as the frontend for IMDE?

ðŸ”¹ Extensibility & Goals
Should IMDE support plugin-based model adapters like AnnFlux does for CLIP and PEFT?

Is there an expectation for IMDE to be annotation-focused (like AnnFlux) or exploration-focused (like embedding analysis, dataset cleaning)?

ðŸ”¹ Evaluation
Are there benchmarks or user-level scenarios we should prepare to compare IMDE + AnnFlux workflows (e.g., annotation speed, label quality, embedding accuracy)?

Is AnnFluxâ€™s PEFT fine-tuning capability something we are expected to include in IMDE as well?
